## About Me
I have honed my expertise through a combination of rigorous programs and hands-on experiences designed to develop a comprehensive understanding of both business and technology. As a graduate of the McKinsey Forward Program, I’ve gained critical thinking and problem-solving strategies tailored for the future of business, with a focus on being an effective communicator and resilient leader.

Through LinkedIn Learning’s Digital Marketing course, I’ve learned how to leverage digital platforms and tools to create targeted strategies that drive business growth, build brand awareness, and enhance customer engagement. This knowledge empowers me to help businesses refine their marketing efforts and reach their target audiences more effectively.

In addition, my IBM Enterprise Design Thinking Practitioner certification equipped me with the tools to design products and services that meet real user needs, delivering exceptional user experiences while aligning with business objectives. This focus on user-centric design allows me to bridge business goals with technical development in ways that maximize both efficiency and impact.

At Moringa School, I completed a comprehensive Software Engineering course, which included both front-end and back-end development. I am proficient in modern technologies such as React, JavaScript, Ruby on Rails, and database management systems like MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQLite. These technical skills allow me to turn business ideas into tangible digital solutions that are scalable, functional, and user-friendly.

Beyond my technical proficiency, I am deeply invested in creating business strategies that prioritize user experience and business outcomes. By utilizing user-centered design, UX research, and ideation, I ensure that the solutions I build not only solve problems but also enhance the overall experience for users. My experience in digital marketing, brand strategy, and business operations ensures that I always approach each project with the long-term business impact in mind.

Whether working with startups or established companies, my mission is to help businesses evolve by combining design thinking, technical development, and business strategy. I aim to provide innovative solutions that drive operational efficiencies, elevate user experiences, and deliver measurable results.
